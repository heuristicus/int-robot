* exercise 2
** estimated pose selection
*** clustering algorithm
   make clustering algorithm take average of best cluster
*** weights
   include weights in the selection of the estimated pose
   highest weighted particle
   highest connected particle of highest weighted particle cluster
   highest weighted cluster average
** sampling methods
  low variance sampling, stratified sampling
** random particles
  random particle MCL: recovery from failures - fox
  relate the random particles injected to the average measurement probability
  get this from the importance factor using (1/M) * sum(w(m,t)) where 1 <= m <= M, and t is the current timestep
  best to average over multiple time steps. keep a short term average and a long term average - there are times 
  where sensor noise is unusually high or spread out because you are doing global localisation
** experiments
  methods for selection of estimated pose
  low variance sampling vs importance weight sampling
  changing noise applied to odometry
