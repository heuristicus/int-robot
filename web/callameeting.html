        <h1>Assignment</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>At a high level the aim of this assignment was to build
    a system for the robot to use in order to find an empty meeting
    room in which the meeting can occur and then proceed to invite and
    guide people to the meeting. At a lower level, this assignment can
    be further broken down into sub goals. The first part of the task
    is to explore and find an empty meeting room. Thus, the robot was
    required to explore the open space, find a meeting room and then ensure it was
    empty, otherwise continue searching for a free meeting room. Once an empty room had been found and identified, the next
    task for the robot was to begin exploring the map to find people
    to invite and guide to the meeting room it has identified as
    empty. To identify people, face detection can be used or laser
    data can be used to identify legs or any other means which
    successfully identify people. Once the robot has guided a person
    to the meeting room, it is to continue exploring for more people
    indefinitely, or until the number of people who were to be found
    are actually found and in the meeting room.</p><br />

		<h1>Problems To Consider For The Assignment</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p> Below are some problems which need to be
          considered for this task:
	    <ul>
	      <li>How to explore to find people and meeting rooms</li>
	      <li>How to validate if meeting room is empty</li>
	      <li>How to detect people</li>
	      <li>How to get to a person who has been detected</li>
	      <li>How to take people who have accepted the invite back
          to the meeting room</li>
	      <li>How to ensure the robot knows its location at all times</li>
	    </ul>
	    </p><br />
                </div>

		<h1>Our Solution</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>We found that in order to complete this task successfully there were 3
          core components which were needed. They are Monte Carlo localisation,
          Probabilistic Roadmap and person detection. We will
          explain each one further below and how they contributed to
          enabling us to complete the assignment.</p><br />

	    <h3>Monte Carlo localisation</h3>
	    <p>Localisation in robotics is the problem of estimating a
	    robot's position in a given map given some laser
	    readings. For the final task we decided to use Adaptive
	    Monte Carlo localisation (AMCL) which is provided within
	    ROS. The difference between MCL and AMCL is that AMCL has a
	    dynamic set of particles. For example, if AMCL is more
	    certain about its position it will reduce the number of
	    total particles, whereas when it is uncertain about its
	    position it will generate more particles in random places.
	    On the other hand, MCL has a constant number of
	    particles. Both localisation methods use particle filters
	    which is the assignment of particles in available
	    positions on a given map. The particles are then
	    continually given probabilities as the robot receives
	    laser data. The probability represents the likelihood of
	    the robot being in that particle's position on the real
	    world map. Particles with low probabilities are removed
	    and replaced nearer to particles with higher probabilities
	    with some noise. In the final task localisation will help
	    your robot keep track of its location allowing other
	    tasks, such as PRM and exploration to be completed
	    successfully. For further information on Monte Carlo
	    localisation, we recommend the following research paper: <a
	    href=
	    "http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub1/dellaert_frank_1999_2/dellaert_frank_1999_2.pdf">Monte
	    Carlo Localization for Mobile Robots</a>.</p>
</br>
	    <h3>Probabilistic Roadmaps</h3>
	    <p>The definition of PRM according to Wikipedia is as follows, the probabilistic roadmap  planner is a
	    motion planning algorithm in robotics, which solves the
	    problem of determining a path between a starting
	    configuration of the robot and a goal configuration while
	    avoiding collisions. The general idea of PRM is to
	    generate random points into the map given to the robot and
	    check these points for validity, i.e. not in walls or too
	    close to walls etc. These points are then connected
	    ensuring connections do not intersect objects and walls
	    and other conditions you may wish to apply. Once points
	    have been connected a start and target position can be
	    provided and from there a route planning algorithm can be
	    applied to find a path using the connections made. For
	    further information, we recommend a read through Robotics
	    Modelling, Planning and Control by Bruno Sicilliano,
	    Lorenzo Sciavicco, Luigi Villiani and Giuseppe Oriolo. In
	    order to avoid unknown objects, we decided when we found
	    an object we would plot it on the map as an object and
	    make PRM plan a route around this object. We also
	    implemented a method by which more nodes were added around
	    and near the object to try and ensure a path was found. We
	    made extensive use of PRM for our system to do all of the
	    navigation. For example when exploring we used PRM to go to nodes
	    which we had generated on the map for exploring. Another
	    example is when a person was detected we again used PRM to navigate to them.
	    Finally when guiding a person to a room, we again used PRM to
	    successfully complete this task.</p>
</br>
	    <h3>Person Detection</h3>
	    <p>Person detection is a large part of the final task and
	    will take up a considerable amount of time to be
	    perfected. There are a variety of ways to approach this
	    problem. We decided to take an innovative approach to this
	    problem and use face detection with the Xbox Kinect. This
	    was used in combination with the open source project
	    OpenCV. In order to be successful with OpenCV you must be
	    familiar with python or C++ as the OpenCV bridge which is
	    required to pass images between ROS and OpenCV is
	    currently only programmed in C++ or Python. We
	    chose to use the Kinect because it would be something
	    different and experimental and also it allowed us to
	    capture depth information. Depth information was used to
	    identify the distance of the person detected and therefore
	    our PRM knew where to plot a target goal. Depth
	    information was also useful for helping us build a model
	    for excluding false positives which were repeatedly being
	    picked up by our face detection software. The model which
	    we designed was based on the idea that, at different
	    distances from the camera, faces will be a different
	    size. The software which we had for face detection drew a
	    square around faces it would detect. Our model would
	    check the size of the square and the distance the face is
            at, if they differed from the model, they were
	    rejected. In order to further advance our people detection
	    we could have possibly used different Haar cascades.</p>
</br>
	    <h3>System Implementation</h3>
	    <p>For our overall implementation we decided to use a
	    finite state machine. For further information on
	    Finite-state machines, please see <a
	    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="new">
	    here</a>. We chose to use a FSM implementation because we
	    decided the goals of the task would be performed
	    sequentially of which only one task can be done at a
	    time. For example the robot could either only be exploring
	    or guiding a person to a meeting room, it could not be
	    doing both at once. Below we have included our finite state machine diagram to show the logical process of our program.</p>
