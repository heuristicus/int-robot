        <h1>Intelligent Robotics</h1>
            <div class="contentText">
			<p> Intelligent Robotics is a 20 credit module which took place during the first semester of our final academic year. As part of the course we were expected to complete four exercises, all of which contributed to the 100% continuous assessment <li>Localisation </li>
			<li>Probabilistic Roadmap </li>
			<li>Call a meeting </li>
			</ul></p><br />
			<p>The first assignment listed above was an introductory assignment which had the purpose of allowing students to understand ROS. It was a simple assignment in which the robot was to explore some open space avoiding obstacles. <br /><br />
			The second assignment was a little more advanced and required us to programme a solution to the localisation problem. The technique for this assignment is well taught in lectures and and therefore we had a simple guideline of how to implement localisation. In simple terms, this is the problem of the robot estimating its location on a given map via the use of laser readings. The localisation which we implemented was Monte Carlo Localisation (MCL).<br /><br />
			The third assignment was a large jump from the second assignment in terms of complexity. We were expected to implement probabilistic roadmap(PRM), which again was taught within lectures. PRM is the task in which a robot must find a path from a given starting location to a given target location. The robot must find a path between the two given locations by firstly plotting random points, connecting the points effectively, planning a route via the use of a suitable route planner and finally driving along the path while using localisation to estimate the pose of the robot. <br /><br />
			The fourth and final assignment was a combination of all previous assignments and was to find an empty meeting room and then invite and guide people to the room. This made use of exploration, localisation and probabilistic road mapping. In order to take an innovative approach to this task, we decided to use the Xbox Kinect and face detection to help find people. We will talk further about this assignment in the <a href="callameeting.html"> Call a meeting </a> page.</p><br /></div>
