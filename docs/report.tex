\begin{abstract}
  We were required to implement a robot system to perform a task similar to the one assigned to participants at the AAAI Mobile Robot Competition in 1996\cite{AAAIcomp}. We did various things to complete the task.
\end{abstract}
\section{Background}
\subsection{Robot Motion}
holonomic robots, PID control, reactive control
\subsection{Localisation}
Bayes filter, Kalman filter, particle filter (MCL), small section about mapping---still an active area of research in robotics. Mention SLAM, which has been pretty much solved.
\subsection{Route Planning}
PRM (sampling methods, graph search), RRT
\subsection{Exploration}
frontier based techniques
\subsection{Robot Vision}
\section{Design}
\subsection{System Structure}
brief ROS description, callback based system, finite state automaton
\subsection{Platform}
Stuff about the pioneer---available sensors, some data about its size, specifications, our additions to it. Kinect specs. Include a picture of the robot with the kinect on it. 
\section{Experimentation}
\subsection{PRM}
\subsection{Vision}
\subsection{Exploration}
\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Performance}
\subsection{Potential Improvements}
\subsection{Conclusions}
