        <h1>What We Would Improve</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>Below we have listed improvements we would have liked to make to our system: <br />
			<ul>
			<li>Improve object detection by plotting an object on the map which is the exact same size as the object in the real world</li>
			<li>Experiment with AMCL to ensure it performs optimally for the given problem. One way which we could have done this was to run tests on AMCL on different maps as we found for the lgfloor map it performed reasonably well however using it on the meetingroom map we saw a drop in performance</li>
			<li>We could have further improved people detection via the use of some form of cross validation. Perhaps we could have used laser data to detect legs when a face was seen or alternatively we could have used more than one Haar cascade, such as the upper body cascade, to help identify people</li>
			<li>Our system was difficult to test as it was only possible to test it properly once the whole system had been implemented. If we were to do this task again we would try to ensure we can test small parts of the system as we build it, to ensure the smaller components are working. Alternatively we could have a very basic system working and then begin to add on the extra features we implemented testing as we added the features </li>
			</ul>

        <h1>Tips For Future Students</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>Below we have listed a few tips and pointers for future students who wish to study the Intelligent Robotics module: <br />
			<ul>
			<li>Intelligent Robotics is a 20 credit module which is 100% assesed by assignments, therefore be prepared to put in a lot of your spare time! </li>
			<li>You must ensure you engage in some background reading after lectures and before engaging in an exercse in order to ensure you understand the assignment and the solution you are about to develop </li>
			<li>If you do use literature, ensure you reference it within your assignment reports </li>
			<li>To help visualise, you could either make your own GUI in Java or alternatively and quicker, you can make use of rviz to display what you wish to see </li>
			<li>Always start the assignment as soon as you complete the previous one. Each assignment is very time consuming and every minute you can gain will make a difference! </li>
			<li>Never leave any work till last minute, even the most trivial of tasks can take a while to implement! </li> 
			<li>Think long and hard about your experiments, try to avoid qualatative experiments and try to concentrate on quantative experiments. (i.e focus on experiments which provide numerical data opposed to experiments which simply state what you observed) </li> 
			<li>Try to become acquainted with the unix framework in order to make your lives simpler. The use of aliases can help save you time and the need to remember long commands  </li> 
			<li>Ensure you make effective use of SVN in order to record message logs of commits and also to ensure your work is backed up somewhere else and is accessible should you wish to work on it from home</li> 
			<li>Read through the ROS API to ensure you get a fuller understand of the components of ROS and the functions which exist </li> 
			<li>Again, this module is very time consuming and heavy, in order to achieve the best marks you will need to dedicate a large chunk of your time to the module, it is both very time consuming and very interesting. At the end of assignments you will be amazed at the progress you make </li>
			</ul>
