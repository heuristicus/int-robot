        <h1>What Was The Assignment?</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>At a high level the aim of this assignment was to build
    a system for the robot to use in order to find an empty meeting
    room in which the meeting can occur and then proceed to invite and
    guide people to the meeting. At a lower level, this assignment can
    be further broken down into sub goals. The first part of the task
    is to explore and find an empty meeting room. So the robot was
    required to explore the open space and then ensure it is
    empty. Once an empty room had been found and identified, the next
    task for the robot was to begin exploring the map to find people
    to invite and guide to the meeting room it has identified as
    empty. To identify people, face detection can be used or laser
    data can be used to identify legs or any other means which
    successfully identify people. Once the robot has guided a person
    to the meeting room, it is to continue exploring for more people
    indefinately, or until the number of people who were to be found
    are actually found and in the meeting room.</p><br />

		<h1>Problems To Consider For The Assignment?</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p> Bullet pointed below are some of the problems which need to be
          considered for this task:
	    <ul>
	      <li>How to explore to find people and meeting rooms ?</li>
	      <li>How to validate if meeting room is empty ?</li>
	      <li>How to detect people ?</li>
	      <li>How get to a person who has been detected ?</li>
	      <li>How to take people who have accepted the invite back
          to the meeting room?</li>
	      <li>How to ensure robot knows its location at all times</li>
	    </ul>
	    </p><br />
                </div>

		<h1>Our Solution</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>We found in order to complete this task successfully there were 3
          core components which were needed. They are Monte Carlo localisation,
          Probabilistic Road Map and people detection. We will
          explain each one further below and how they contributed to
          enabling us to complete the assignment.</p><br />

	    <h3>Monte Carlo Localisation</h3>
	    <p>Localisation in robotics is the problem of estimating a
	    robots position in a given map given some laser
	    readings. <b><u>STILL NEED TO EXPLAIN LOCALISATION HERE</u></b>. For further information on Monte Carlo
	    localisation, we recommend the following research paper: <a
	    href=
	    "http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub1/dellaert_frank_1999_2/dellaert_frank_1999_2.pdf">Monte
	    Carlo Localization for Mobile Robots</a>.</p>
</br>
	    <h3>Probabilistic Road Maps</h3>
	    <p>Probabilisic road maps are a solution to the robot path
	    finding problem, where a robot is given a start location
	    and a target location and is required to calculate and
	    navigate along a path to the target location. <b><u>TALK ABOUT
	    THE PRM PROCESS</u></b></p>
</br>
	    <h3>People Detection</h3>
	    <p><b><u>TALK ABOUT HOW WE DETECTED PEOPLE WHEN USING KINECT AND
	    DEPTH INFORMATION ALSO NEED TO TALK ABOUT OUR FINITE STATE
	    MACHINE IMPLEMENTATION</u></b></p>
