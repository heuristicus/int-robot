- Passive voice vs active voice. Pick one and normalise the whole thing!
- tenses normalised - do we describe experiments in past or present tense?
- No subjective statements!

- Kinect capitalised (done with find+replace - check please)
- All 'figure X' references are correct
- Figures are in the right place
- ROC graph/curve consistency in naming
- ise/ize
- Axis labels are correct
- Axis labels have correct units
- 'Sampling method'
- 'Connection strategy'
- Make sure statements are consistent throughout (if we say we use one thing but later say we use something else, bad things will happen!)
- apostrophes
- check that methods in algorithms are the same
- Haar capitalised
- citations in correct place
- section introductions
- experiments should have aim, method and results section only
- prm sampling method minimum = optimum?
- more numbers in results sections of experiments
- capitalisation in graphs and tables - should it be Minimum Time or Minimum time
- captions for tables and graphs etc give reasonable amount of information
- captions for tables - is missing out "the" ok? ("graph showing the distribution of" or "graph showing distribution of")
- missed persons data in final experiment is weird. Should be independent of distance
- Capitalisation on axis labels (particularly specificity)
- Ensure we have reasonable hypothesis for experiments
